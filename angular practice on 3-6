route change event using $routeChangeStart

$scope.$on("$routeChangeStart",function(event,next, current){
		if(!confirm("Are you sure you want to navigate away from this page to : "+next.$$route.originalPath)){
			event.preventDefault();
			console.log(event);
			console.log(next);
			console.log(current);
		}
		
	});
  
  
  we cant also use $locationChangeStart event the only difference between these two is that using this we can get the complete url
  for next and current events.
  
  
  there are four events triggerred when we navigate to other page those are 
  $routeChangeStart
  $routeChangeSuccess
  $locationChangeStart
  $locationChangeSuccess
